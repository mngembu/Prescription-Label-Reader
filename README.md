# Prescription Label Reading Using Computer Vision

This project recognizes and identifies the text in the prescription labels and reads out the name of medicine, the dosage limits, the number of refills prescribed and the expiry date of the refills, to the visually impaired or elderly patients.

Enabling voice messages can make it
easier for elderly people to understand your message. Text-to-Speech can provide peace
of mind by empowering you to give better services. For example, you could even send
voice messages that read prescription labels.
This can be a real challenge for anyone with reading difficulties, not to mention the elderly
and visually impaired. A talking label, sent straight to your device, makes it easy to know
everything about your medication. Dosage info can also be tracked and shared with caregivers.
